<h3>How was the creation process for me ? </h3>
<p>Personally it was a very difficult process. It was my first big project building from scratch, so it was challenging in a way, but after you get used to how to really search for something that you don't know, and keep learning in the process, in the end, after everything that you planned it's working just fine, there is only  joy :heart_eyes: </p>

## Building Process
1. First I started developing the visual scratch of the app on a piece of paper to get a better idea of what I would have to do
2. Then it was time to code, first I developed the launch screen with the app logo and a quote, meaning that quotes would play a part on the app, after that I created the launch screen animation with the colored circles circling the app logo, with the meaning that colors would be part of the app too. This animation process it was very good for me because made me learn and understand how animations in UIKit worked
3. It was time to create the CoreData items and relationships...
4. It was time to create the first screen, which has a very simple design. It consist in oly one NavigationBar, a label, and a Collection View;
5. The Navigation Bar was easy, only place a title of the app's name, two right bar buttons, one a trash can with the functionality of deleting the item from the collectionView and the CoreData, and the button next to it is the plus button with the functionality of creating a new item for the collectionView and the CoreData
